Methode Efficiency

Method 1 : add word
	Time complexity : O(log n)

Method 2 : findWord
	Time complextiy: O(log n)

Method 3 : deleteWord
	Time complexity: O(log n)

Method 4: findSimilar
	Time complexity: O(m * log n)
 	note: m is the number of variations a word can have statisfying the rule that the differevnce should be by only one
 	letter. And the (log n) comes from the findWord method which is used inside this method.
